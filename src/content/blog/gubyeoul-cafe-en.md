# Gubyeoul Cafe in Yangpyeong — A Perfect Riverside Cafe for Families with Kids

We've found our go-to cafe for Yangpyeong day trips. **Gubyeoul** (구벼울) is known as the cafe run by Korean actress Nam Sang-mi. The name comes from the old Korean word describing how the river curves like a horseshoe at this spot.

## A River View That Takes Your Breath Away

The moment you step inside, the panoramic view of the Namhan River through floor-to-ceiling windows steals the show. Even our kids were mesmerized — they sat by the window and quietly gazed at the frozen river for a good while. The winter scenery had its own charm.

## Ondol Room — The Real Game Changer

If you have little ones, the **ondol (heated floor) room** is the highlight. Kids can take off their shoes, crawl around freely, and play on the warm floor. It's a completely different level of comfort compared to wrestling toddlers in regular cafe seating. Parents sip coffee in peace while kids roll around — not many cafes offer this luxury.

## Drinks & Bakery

The drinks were solid overall. Their signature item is the **salt bread** (소금빵), which tends to sell out early — so get there sooner rather than later if you want to try it.

## Practical Info

- **Address:** 123-19, Namhangangbyeon-gil, Okcheon-myeon, Yangpyeong-gun, Gyeonggi-do
- **Hours:** Daily 10:00 AM – 9:00 PM
- **Phone:** 070-8801-2319
- **Parking:** Plenty of space, no stress
- **Kid-friendly:** Ondol room available, spacious interior
- **Must-try:** Salt bread (arrives early, sells out fast)

## Bottom Line

> The combo of a stunning river view and a warm ondol room makes Gubyeoul close to the perfect cafe for families with young kids.
