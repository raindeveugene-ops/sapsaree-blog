# Amsa Prehistoric Site with an 18-Month-Old — Indoor Fun on a Cold Day

If you're wondering where to take a toddler on a freezing winter day in Seoul, **Amsa-dong Prehistoric Site** is a great option. While there's an outdoor park with reconstructed pit houses, the indoor museum alone is more than enough to keep a little one entertained.

## Fish Exhibit — The Toddler's Favorite

The first-floor exhibition features fish specimens and models from the Han River. Our 18-month-old was captivated by the colorful fish displays, standing and staring for quite a while. The exhibits are at the perfect height for a toddler to explore on their own.

## Prehistoric Dioramas — Visual Stimulation

Life-sized dioramas of prehistoric people fishing and hunting caught our little one's attention through the glass. He's obviously too young to understand history, but the visual impact of full-scale figures was more than enough to keep him curious and engaged.

## Pit House Reconstruction — The Grand Finale

A large-scale reconstruction of a Neolithic pit house had our toddler gripping the railing and peering in with fascination. The thatched roof and the figures working inside held his gaze for a surprisingly long time.
